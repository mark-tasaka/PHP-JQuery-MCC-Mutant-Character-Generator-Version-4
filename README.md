# PHP-JQuery-MCC-Mutant-Character-Generator-Version-4
The fourth iteration of the Mutant Crawl Classics (MCC) Mutant Character Generator, which builds upon the MCC Mutant Character Generator Version 3 (https://github.com/mark-tasaka/php-jquery-mcc-mutant-character-generator-version-3). The MCC Mutant Character Genenerator allows Users to generate a random Mutant Character with a series of options available for customizing the randomly generated character.

The two most notable differences between Version 3 and Version 4 of the MCC Mutant Character Generators are:

1.	The random name generator for Version 4 is built upon the PHP-Character-Name-Generator (https://github.com/mark-tasaka/PHP-Character-Name-Generator); thus providing both a greater selection of random names, and the ability to customize random name by selecting names based on country of origins.

2.	The ability to customize ability score through the selection of ability score values.
